Adding a new theme:

Select the scheme in the terminal
Create a directory for the new scheme, e.g. roperdot/config/color-schemes/source/newscheme
Run gen-color-source on the scheme's .Xresources file and redirect the output to roperdot/config/color-schemes/source/newscheme/color-defs.txt
Run compare-color-scheme on color-defs.txt to see the derived colors for the scheme compared to the terminal colors
Run show-all-256-colors.py to see all 256 available colors (https://github.com/mgedmin/scripts/blob/master/show-all-256-colors)
Import the .Xresources data at http://terminal.sexy for comparison
For colors that weren't matched well, run compare-colors to find the best color, e.g. compare-colors black 16 232 233 234 235 236
Update color-defs.txt and repeat until the set looks good
Run gen-color-files to generate the color files for the scheme, e.g. gen-color-files newscheme
Use http://terminal.sexy to export mintty and iTerm2 themes and place the contents for each in theme files in directories under roperdot/config/color-schemes



If colors need to be changed in the terminal color-scheme files:

Find the RGB value for the ANSI colors here: https://jonasjacek.github.io/colors/
Update the .Xresources file
Go to http://terminal.sexy
Select the Import tab
Paste the contents of the .Xresources file
Click Import
Select the Export tab
Select iTerm2
Click Export
Copy the text
Update the file in roperdot/config/color-schemes/iTerm2
Select MinTTY
Click Export
Copy the text
Update the file in roperdot/config/color-schemes/mintty
Copy the updated mintty file to ~/.mintty/themes
Run compare-color-scheme again to compare and verify
