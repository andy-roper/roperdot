## Advanced Configuration

### Updating Scripts for Apps on Your System

This is typically done when you need to add handling for additional applications not accounted for in the distributed copy of update-app-binaries. update-app-binaries creates scripts in app-bin-bash and app-bin-zsh based on the applications that are installed on your system.

Make the necessary changes for your applications in roperdot/bin-bash/update-app-binaries, source source-scripts/copy-scripts to update the scripts in bin-bash and bin-zsh, and then execute update-app-binaries. Alternatively, you can directly modify update-app-binaries for your shell (e.g. in bin-zsh) and then execute it.

update-app-binaries will update the scripts in app-bin-bash and app-bin-zsh that are used to open files in GUI viewers/editors.

To support file extensions that currently don't have an associated application in zsh, you'll also want to update roperdot/.zsh-suffix-aliases.

### Application Installation JSON Structure

Each OS has (if applicable) a shell apps JSON file and a GUI apps JSON file that defines how applications are installed. These files are located in install-profiles/<profile-name> (install-profiles/standard for the included install profile).

Here's an explanation of the properties of the installation definitions in the JSON files:

| Property            | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `app`               | Name of the app (referenced during the install)              |
| `bundle_name`       | (MacOS) Bundle name, i.e. the directory in Applications (if different than app) |
| `package`           | Package name used by the package manager                     |
| `package_manager`   | Package manager used to install the application, e.g. brew, apt, choco, etc. |
| `list_prerequisite` | (Optional) Package manager required to be present in order to include the app in the install list |
| `binary`            | (Used for shell apps) Binary to check for to determine if the package is already installed |
| `presence_command`  | (Optional) Command to execute to check if the package is installed (mainly used for libraries) |
| `install_script`    | (Optional) Script to use to install the application instead of direct installation with the package manager |
| `appDir`            | (Optional) Directory to check for within the applications directory to determine if the application is installed; used with `install_script` for GUI applications |
| `install_command`   | (Optional) Command to use to install the application         |
| `groups`            | (Optional) Array of groups for which to install the application; if not present, the application will be installed regardless of the group(s) designated when installing |
| `exclusionGroups`   | (Optional) Array of groups for which the application should **not** be installed |
| `disabledByDefault` | (Optional) Exclude the application from the ones to install **unless** it's in a group and that group is referenced when installing |
| `sudo_not_required` | (Optional) Don't require sudo to install the application     |

If neither install_script nor install_command are defined, the package_manager will be used to install the application.

## History

I was exposed to Unix and shell scripting when I attended university. I already had a lot of experience with DOS commands and batch files by then, so it came fairly naturally.

Soon after graduating I discovered [4DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4DOS), a greatly enhanced command interpreter for MS-DOS and Windows. Several years later, JP Software released [Take Command](https://jpsoft.com/products/take-command.html), a Windows console with the same features and more. Being primarily a Windows user, that was my shell of choice for quite a few years.

Around 2017, I began working on a project for a client that required frequently remoting into their RHEL server. I adapted many of my Take Command batch files to shell aliases, functions and scripts.

Then I found out about the concept of dotfiles. I set up Cygwin on my Windows machine and ported my scripts etc. there and converted them to work on Windows. I updated my dotfiles to use the [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) package manager to install applications. Then I did the same for my company MacBook and used [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install applications on that platform.

When WSL became viable for me on Windows with the advent of WSL 2, I switched to using Ubuntu on that platform instead of Cygwin. I also built a couple of Linux machines at home and set up my dotfiles on them as well.

In 2025, I updated my dotfiles to incorporate the concept of app "groups" and to support installation on macOS without admin access for compatibility with an upcoming client project.

## To Do/Future Plans

- Test and retool Ubuntu/Mint installs if necessary after the recent MacOS-centric retooling

- Update other OSes’ shell-apps JSON files similarly to how the MacOS one was updated
  - Remove html5print and xml2json
  - Add cssbeautifier, beautifulsoup4, pypdf and xmltodict Python libraries
  
- Update other OSes' installed shell apps
  - Add awscli, ffmpeg, gifsicle (if available)
  
- Update other OSes’ installed GUI apps
  - Add Brave browser; disable WebStorm
  
- Add installation of Playwright Python library to other OSes' shell-apps JSON files

- Consider adding VMware Fusion (Mac) or VMware Workstation Pro (others) to installs

- Consider adding additional AWS apps to installs

  - aws-sam-cli (awssamcli in Chocolatey), session-manager-plugin, terraform

- Consider adding a space visualizer install to Mint and Ubuntu GUI apps, either QDirStat or Baobab

- Figure out how to eliminate warning from mergepdfs and pdfcount scripts:
  WARNING: (<class 'ply.yacc.VersionError'>, VersionError('yacc table file version is out of date'), <traceback object at 0x7fbbd69a0b00>)

- Add comment to install scripts that rely on a hardcoded version number/URL that I can grep on like:

  \# Hardcoded version reference: SQL Developer v23.1.1.345.2114, last updated on 9/23/2025

  - Create a script named “list-hardcoded-installs” to do a recursive grep to list them

- Finish implementing change scheme

- Test upgrading to a later Python version (e.g. 3.13)

  - Need to ask user about switching to newer version instead of arbitrarily doing so
  - Will need to reinstall Python packages for scripts in bin to use it properly
  - Will need to update installs to add install/upgrade to latest python version
  - `brew install python` or `brew upgrade python`
  
- Revisit installing non-standard installation

  - Need to support a different/second install profile
  - Need to support installing a second profile after installing standard
  
- Consider trying [scoop](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Scoop) to install GUI apps for non-admin Windows users

- Integrate eza, a modern ls alternative: https://github.com/eza-community/eza

- Integrate bat, a modern cat alternative: https://github.com/sharkdp/bat

- Other apps to evaluate and possibly integrate:

  - [btop](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop): resource monitor
  - [choose](https://github.com/theryangeary/choose): human-friendly cut/awk alternative
  - [delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta): syntax-highlighting pager for git, diff, grep and blame
  - [duf](https://github.com/muesli/duf): disk usage/free utility
  - [dust](https://github.com/bootandy/dust): more intuitive version of du
  - [httpie](https://github.com/httpie/cli): user-friendly HTTP client
  - [procs](https://github.com/dalance/procs): modern ps alternative
  
- Update VS Code configuration when switching scheme (colors only)

- Update install for Oracle SQL Developer to support Linux

- Institute use of print_important_message during after after install

  - Use while installing to print important messages and to accumulate them to re-print them at the end of the install
  - Use for things like running update-vscode-settings for VS Code, importing iTerm2 profile, etc.
